## 🚀 Reddit Strategy

**Subreddits:** r/Frugal, r/CICO, r/xxfitness (be careful), r/PersonalFinance

**Post Title:**
> "I built a calculator to track the 5-year cost of Ozempic vs. Natural Dieting (taking inflation into account)."

**Post Body:**
> My insurance denied me for Wegovy, so I went down a rabbit hole calculating the actual out-of-pocket cost of these drugs vs. just hiring a private chef or using AI tools. 
>
> I built a little web tool to project the costs over 5 years. It turns out the breakeven point is faster than I thought.
>
> If anyone wants to check their own "ROI" on weight loss, it's free here:
> [Link to Calculator: stayfitwithai.com/ozempic-calculator.html]
>
> P.S. I also listed the AI tools I'm using to replace "discipline" with "automation" (ChatGPT for meal plans etc) if anyone is interested:

## 🐦 X (Twitter) Strategy

**Reply 1:**
> [Insert Screenshot of Calculator Graph]
> 
> The average out-of-pocket cost for Wegovy is ~$1350/mo.
> Over 5 years (with 6% medical inflation), that's nearly $100k.
>
> Even a "expensive" organic diet + AI coaching tools costs 1/10th of that.

**Reply 2:**
