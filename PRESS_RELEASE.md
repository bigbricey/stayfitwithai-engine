# Press Release: Free Ozempic Cost Calculator Reveals True 5-Year Price of Weight Loss Drugs

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

## New Online Tool Shows Americans the Hidden Long-Term Cost of GLP-1 Medications

**[City, State] – December 15, 2025** – As millions of Americans consider weight loss drugs like Ozempic, a new free online calculator is helping consumers understand the true financial impact of these medications over time.

The **Ozempic Cost Calculator**, available at [StayFitWithAI.com](https://stayfitwithai.com/ozempic-calculator.html), reveals that the 5-year cost of popular GLP-1 medications can exceed **$67,000** when accounting for pharmaceutical price inflation—a figure that surprises many prospective users.

### The Hidden Cost Problem

While the monthly cost of Ozempic (approximately $935-$1,000 without insurance) is widely known, most patients fail to consider the long-term financial commitment. With pharmaceutical prices rising an average of 6% annually, the cumulative cost over years of treatment adds up quickly.

"People hear about celebrities losing weight on these drugs and assume it's a quick fix," says the StayFitWithAI team. "What they don't realize is that studies show most users regain weight when they stop—meaning these could be lifetime costs, not temporary ones."

### Insurance Coverage Declining

The calculator comes at a critical time. According to recent data, commercial insurance coverage for Ozempic **decreased by 22% from 2024 to 2025**, leaving over 1.1 million Americans without coverage they previously had. Many insurers now require prior authorization or deny coverage for weight loss use entirely.

### How the Calculator Works

Users can:
- Select their medication (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, or Zepbound)
- Enter their monthly cost
- Indicate their insurance status
- Receive an instant projection of their 5-year costs with inflation

The tool also compares brand-name drugs to more affordable alternatives, including compounded versions and natural metabolic boosters.
