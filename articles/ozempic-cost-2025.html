                <h3>💰 Quick Answer</h3>
                <p><strong>Without insurance:</strong> $935 - $1,000 per month<br>
                    <strong>With insurance:</strong> $25 - $100 per month (with savings card)<br>

            </div>

            <p>If you're considering Ozempic for weight loss or diabetes management, the cost is probably your biggest
                concern. And rightfully so—this drug isn't cheap.</p>

            <p>Here's the full breakdown of what Ozempic costs in 2025, including insurance options and more affordable
                alternatives.</p>

            <h2>Ozempic Cost Without Insurance</h2>

            <p>The manufacturer's list price for Ozempic (semaglutide) is <strong>$997.58 per month</strong> in the
                United States. At retail pharmacies, you'll typically pay between $935 and $1,200 depending on the
                pharmacy and your location.</p>

            <p>For perspective, that's:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>$11,220 per year</strong> at baseline</li>
                <li><strong>$56,000+ over 5 years</strong> (without accounting for price increases)</li>
                <li><strong>$67,000+ over 5 years</strong> (with typical 6% annual pharmaceutical inflation)</li>
            </ul>

                projection.</p>

            <h2>Ozempic Cost With Insurance</h2>

            <p>If your insurance covers Ozempic, the cost drops dramatically:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>With manufacturer savings card:</strong> As low as $25/month</li>
                <li><strong>Typical copay range:</strong> $25 - $100/month</li>
                <li><strong>High-deductible plans:</strong> Full cost until deductible is met</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout-box">
                <h3>⚠️ Important: Coverage Is Decreasing</h3>
                <p>From 2024 to 2025, commercial insurance coverage for Ozempic <strong>decreased by 22%</strong>. Over
                    1.1 million people lost coverage. Many insurers now require prior authorization or deny coverage for
                    weight loss use entirely.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why Is Ozempic So Expensive?</h2>

            <p>Several factors contribute to Ozempic's high price:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>No generic available:</strong> Novo Nordisk holds the patent until 2031</li>
                <li><strong>High demand:</strong> Celebrity endorsements drove massive demand</li>
                <li><strong>Limited competition:</strong> Only a few GLP-1 drugs exist</li>
                <li><strong>Manufacturing costs:</strong> Biologics are complex to produce (though estimates suggest
                    actual production cost is as low as $5/month)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cheaper Alternatives to Ozempic</h2>

            <h3>1. Compounded Semaglutide (~$297/month)</h3>
            <p>Compounding pharmacies create custom versions of semaglutide at a fraction of the cost. These are legal
                during the FDA-declared shortage. Telehealth providers like Ro and Hims offer these.</p>

            <h3>2. Natural Alternatives (~$59/month)</h3>
            <p>For those who can't afford or don't want injections, natural metabolic boosters target similar pathways
                without the side effects. These won't deliver the same dramatic results, but many users report
                sustainable weight loss without the "rebound effect" seen with GLP-1 drugs.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Ozempic is expensive—there's no way around it. Without insurance, you're looking at nearly $1,000/month
                and potentially over $67,000 over 5 years.</p>

            <p>Before committing, consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Will weight return when you stop? (Studies suggest yes for many users)</li>
                <li>Can you afford this long-term?</li>
                <li>Have you tried sustainable alternatives first?</li>
            </ul>
